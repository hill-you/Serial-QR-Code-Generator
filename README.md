# Serial-QR-Code-Generator
<p>The program allows you to generate and print a series of QR codes. However, you need to create a template first. The template is created on the basis of a bmp file, to which a configuration ini file is added. In the configuration file, each section corresponds to one element: QR code or text.</p>

<p>You can set the content, position and size for the QR code. The content can contain both static text and variable (number, date, time, random number or text). The number and time are incremented for each subsequent one.</p>

<p>You can set parameters for the text: content, font, size, character width, angle of inclination, position. The content can contain both static text and variable (number, date, time, random number or text). The number and time are incremented for each subsequent one.</p>

<p>Sample templates are available.</p>
